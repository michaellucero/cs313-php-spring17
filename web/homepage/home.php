          <p class="textleft">Hello everyone, My name is Michael Lucero. I am super excited this semester to be apart of CS 313 where
             I plan to learn some amazing stuff. I am a student studying Computer Science. I am a big fan of biking and
             the outdoors.</p>
          <p class="textright">This page is going to grow and will be added to throughout the semester. The image that you see was a
          creation I came up with to show that light will always shine into ones life.</p>
